# Grocery Store Management System

This is a tutorial on building a grocery store management system using a three-tier application development approach. The application will consist of a front-end user interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a back-end server implemented with Python Flask, and a MySQL database for data storage.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- MySQL installed and running
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grocery-store-management-system.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd grocery-store-management-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   - Create a MySQL database for the project.
   - Update the database configuration in the `config.py` file located in the `backend` directory.

5. Run the Flask server:

   ```
   python backend/app.py
   ```

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the grocery store management system.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
grocery-store-management-system/
├── backend/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── config.py
│   └── ...
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- The `backend` directory contains the Python Flask server code.
- The `frontend` directory contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists the required Python packages for the project.

## Development

You can modify and extend the project based on your requirements. Here are some possible features to consider:

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add additional functionality for managing inventory, orders, and payments.
- Improve the user interface design and user experience.
- Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

Feel free to explore and enhance the project according to your needs.
